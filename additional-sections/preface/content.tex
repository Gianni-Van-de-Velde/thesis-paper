For this thesis, I had the opportunity to write my own proposal. I wanted to work on the energy efficiency of LLMs and more specifically in RAG scenarios. Needless to say, I am very excited about the topic. There are three passions of mine, that I could combine in this thesis: a passion for AI, efficiency and environmental friendliness. 

More people helped me with this paper than I can list here. I would like to thank all of them. Especially, I would like to thank my counselor ir. CÃ©dric Goemaere and promotors for this thesis. They gave me much freedom while researching, while still following closely and guiding me with valuable and actionable feedback. Also, Christiaan, Julie, Tom and Corine of UZGent deserve a special mention, because they all put significant effort into helping me get results in time. The project at UZGent could have easily taken years if it had not been for the great efforts they made. Lastly, I would like to thank my friends with whom I shared countless hours on the 11th floor of IGent, each working on their own thesis. Certainly Arthur, Bram and Quinten helped much by thinking and discussing with me, and they also helped me to forget about my thesis for a second during breaks.
