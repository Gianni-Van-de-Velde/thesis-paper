\chapter{Deliverables to UZGent}

In this thesis we worked together with UZGent and we made sure both parties benefited from the collaboration. From our side, we deliver the following data and documents to UZGent:

\begin{itemize}
    \item RAG system setup guide. The guide contains all necessary steps to set up a vanilla Red Hat server, such that it can run the RAG system we developed.
    \item Access to the RAG system GitHub and the frontend GitHub on demand.
    \item Test session data. We held a test session to gather typical questions from healthcare professionals and the corresponding document in Zenya. This resulted in a validate and test set that UZGent can use to verify the performance of any retriever on Zenya data. This data was delivered in the form of CSVs.
\end{itemize}
